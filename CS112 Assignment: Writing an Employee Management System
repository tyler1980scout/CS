/*
This code is made for the study.com assignment Computer Science 112: Programming in C++ 

It will enable an employee to login, and based on their profile credentials, see different menus depending on their position

***From assignment itself below:***
***********************************
-For this assignment, you will write a program that keeps track of employees at a company.
-Three types of users can access the system: Human Resources, Management, and General Employees. 
  -A Human Resources user will be able to add, view, search, modify, and delete    employees. 
  -A Management user can only search and view employees. 
  -A General Employee user can only view his or her own file. Employee files       will have at least the employee's name and numeric user id.

Your program will implement a management information system:
-The minimum requirements of the system are: implement a base employee class that will be defined for each employee type or function, implement a log-in feature, and the login will determine what functions are accessible to the employee.
-The program will be interactive. At a minimum, a log-in screen and menu screen will be used. Input should be validated for correct login credentials.
-Functions and classes should be used where appropriate to produce readable, reusable code. Library functions and user-defined functions should be used where appropriate.
-The program will be well-commented/documented, including a comment block at the top of the document (document header comment) as well as line comments
